I made a random ahhh project that literally adds NOTHING but you can install plugins for it (The plugins can be ANYTHING.)


# How to contribute

1) Get the actual project and in "plugins" experiment with making a plugin then just upload it to somewhere with read access
2) Pull request here with your plugin's METADATA.
3) Wait
4) Wait
5) Your Plugin is installable!
